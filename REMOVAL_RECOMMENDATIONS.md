# Removal Recommendations

## 1. ✅ `blob-url-mapping.json` - SAFE TO REMOVE

**Status**: Currently untracked (not in git)

**Why it's safe**:
- No longer used by the application
- `blobImageMap.ts` constructs URLs directly now
- Only generated by `scripts/upload-images-to-blob.js`, but not needed

**Recommendation**:
- Add to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- Can delete locally if you want, but keeping it doesn't hurt (just ignored)

**Action**:
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "blob-url-mapping.json" >> .gitignore

# Optionally delete it (it will be regenerated if needed)
rm blob-url-mapping.json
```

## 2. ⚠️ Images in `public/team/teamPhotos/` and `public/about/media/` - NOT YET SAFE

**Current Size**: ~13.5MB (1.5MB team photos + 12MB media)

### Why NOT Safe Yet:

#### Team Photos (`public/team/teamPhotos/`) - PARTIALLY SAFE
- ✅ CSV files reference paths like `/team/teamPhotos/neha_naveen.webp`
- ✅ `MemberCard.tsx` converts these to blob URLs at runtime
- ⚠️ **BUT**: Placeholder image (`ABteam1.webp`) still needs to exist locally for fallback
- ⚠️ **AND**: If you remove images, local development won't have them (though it will work via blob URLs)

#### Media Photos (`public/about/media/`) - NOT SAFE
- ❌ `src/app/media/getAlbums.ts` uses `fs.readdirSync()` at **build time**
- ❌ Scans local filesystem to discover images for album listings
- ❌ If files are removed, the media page won't discover any images
- ❌ Media pages still use local paths, not blob URLs

### When It Will Be Safe:

1. **Update Media Page to Use Blob URLs**:
   - Modify `getAlbums.ts` to construct blob URLs directly (similar to `blobImageMap.ts`)
   - OR use a configuration file listing albums/images
   - Update `src/app/media/page.tsx` to use blob URLs

2. **Then Remove Images**:
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore
   echo "/public/team/teamPhotos/*.webp" >> .gitignore
   echo "/public/about/media/" >> .gitignore
   
   # Remove from git (keeps local files)
   git rm -r --cached public/team/teamPhotos/*.webp
   git rm -r --cached public/about/media/
   ```

### Recommendation:

**Keep images in git for now** because:
- ✅ Build process works
- ✅ Local development works  
- ✅ Media page discovers images correctly
- ✅ Team photos already use blob URLs in production

**Remove after media page migration**:
- Once media pages use blob URLs
- Once build doesn't depend on local files
- Then you'll save 13.5MB in git repository

## Summary

| Item | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| `blob-url-mapping.json` | ✅ Safe to remove | Add to `.gitignore` |
| `public/team/teamPhotos/` | ⚠️ Wait | Keep for now (or remove after media migration) |
| `public/about/media/` | ❌ Don't remove yet | Keep until media page uses blob URLs |
