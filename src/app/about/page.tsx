                We built the first prototype of our boat, transitioning from a
                catamaran to a more stable trimaran design. While the mechanical
                team led this shift, the software team focused on developing
                path planning algorithms and a computer vision model. We also
                began integrating ROS into our system.

                RoboBoat 2024 would take place nearly two months earlier than
                expected. Despite this, we still decided to build an entirely
                new boat, Clifford, which was fully designed and manufactured in
                just one semester. Clifford is stronger, faster, and more stable
                than George, providing the team with a more reliable hardware
                platform to build upon in the future. The software team revamped
                the codebase, integrated a compass and GPS, and improved the
                vision models. Additionally, the Ground Station project and
                virtual simulations were developed. At competition, we qualified
                for finals again, and we won a design documentation award for
                our website.
