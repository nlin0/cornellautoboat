          The ROS (Robot Operating System) and Simulations team uses the ROS
          software libraries and tools to enable communication between the
          Perception, AI, and Controls code. Members spend a lot of time
          thinking about the big picture of our codebase, optimizing its
          design and usability, troubleshooting integration issues, and
          ensuring the rest of the team’s code is compatible. Additionally,
          this team is responsible for creating a simulations framework for
          the AI and controls team to test their code in isolation.

          This year we made a couple major changes to our ROS framework, and
          we also had immense progress on the simulations front. With ROS, we
          upgraded to a Jetson Orin AGX with Ubuntu 22.04 and thus migrated
          our entire system to ROS2. Further, to incorporate the new LiDAR
          sensor, we created a new LiDAR node that handles point cloud data
          and its associated processing algorithms. Below is a schematic of
          our current setup, which is still subject to change.

          With simulations, we created version 1 of our RoboBoat simulation.
          This version is created in Unity and uses a ROS TCP connection node
          to connect our codebase to the Unity client. More specifically, this
          simulation mocks perception and controls code so that the AI team
          can test path planning code in isolation. It includes a generic map
          of the RoboBoat competition course, as well as basic capability
          for level making. Below is an example of path planning code (i.e.
          follow the buoy) running in our simulation.

          In the future, the ROS & Simulations team hopes to flesh out and
          refine the codebase to be cross-compatible with both ROS and ROS2.
          We also anticipate building upon the simulations, perhaps
          incorporating 3D rendering, so LIDAR-based navigation can be
          tested as well.
