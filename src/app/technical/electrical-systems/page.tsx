          E-Systems coordinate the flow of information and power between all
          the boat's components, by developing custom PCBs and implementing
          electrical infrastructure, serving as the vital bridge between
          hardware and software.

        <p className={styles.descr}>
          At the heart of E-Systems lies the power distribution board, which
          routes power at appropriate and precise voltage levels to our boat's
          low-power components including microcontrollers, our kill switch
          relay, and our transceiver. The board takes an input of 14.8V from
          our BlueRobotics Lithium-Ion battery, which is then routed through
          an input protection IC, ensuring that our sensitive components
          are not exposed to overvoltage or a surge of current. Next,
          voltage regulators step down the input voltage to 12V and 5V
          for the components mentioned above

          Another critical power system E-systems is responsible for is our
          killswitch, a needed safety feature for our high-power electronics.
          Our killswitch PCB features a two-form 45A/50A switching relay,
          which allows us to kill our thrusters and robotic motors with the
          press of a button. Additionally, when the kill button is pressed,
          a MOSFET is turned on, allowing current to flow from the drain to
          the source and sending a 5V signal to our Arduino microcontroller,
          letting it know that the killswitch was activated.

          Beyond power, E-Systems oversees communication, selecting and
          implementing transceivers and microcontrollers. These devices
          facilitate remote control capabilities, and ensure that all of
          the intricate control pathways between the computer and the motors
          are operating smoothly.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.descr}>
          E-Systems is also responsible for facilitating WiFi communication
          with our on-shore control system. Our custom power over ethernet
          PCB gives our mounted bullet antenna power, and transfers data to
          our main on-board computer.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.descr}>
          Looking into the future we are excited to integrate sensors and
          controllers for our advanced capabilities on Robotics, such as
          the robotic arm. The electrical team is also working on interesting
          new circuit board designs, such as custom ESCs and boost converters.
